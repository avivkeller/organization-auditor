# organization-auditor

A GitHub Action that audits a GitHub organization for inactive members and files a tracking issue when findings exist. **Never removes anyone** - it only reports.

## What "inactive" means

A member is **inactive** if **either**:

1. They have had no interaction (commit, PR opened, PR review, issue opened, optionally comments) in any org repo for the last N days (default 90), **or**
2. They are not a member of any team.

Per-team audits are opt-in **per team**, via the team's GitHub description: include a token of the form `repo: owner/board-repo` (or `repo: [owner/board-repo]`) anywhere in the description, and the action will audit that team and file its report issue in the named repo. Teams without the token are skipped. A team member is inactive in this audit if they have had no interaction with any of the team's repositories in the window.

## Reporting behavior

Reports are published only when inactive users are found. In that case, each organization or team audit owns one open tracking issue identified by its audit labels, and subsequent runs update that issue's body in place. A clean audit does not look up, create, update, or close an issue. The action never creates or edits issue comments, and it also skips the write when a generated body has not changed.

## Usage

```yaml
name: Audit organization
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * 1' # every Monday 09:00 UTC
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      issues: write
    steps:
      - uses: avivkeller/organization-auditor@v1
        with:
          org: my-org
          token: ${{ secrets.ORG_AUDIT_TOKEN }}
          inactivity-days: 90
          ignore-members: 'svc-deploy,svc-backup'
```

### Token

The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` is **not sufficient** - it is scoped to the running repository, but this action needs to read org membership, teams, and contributions across the org.

You must provide a token with:

- `read:org` (list members, teams, team membership)
- `repo` (read commits/issues/PRs/comments across org repos)

A **fine-grained PAT** owned by an org admin or a **GitHub App installation token** with the equivalent permissions both work. Pass it via the `token` input.

| `inactive-count` | Total inactive members in the org-wide report.                                             |
| `issue-url`      | URL of the org-wide report issue (empty when no inactive members are found or in dry-run). |

## Caching

The action uses [`@actions/cache`](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/cache) to persist the most recent observed `lastSeen` per member across runs. This has two effects:

1. **Faster runs.** When a cached `lastSeen` falls inside the current inactivity window, the action skips the API probe for that member entirely.
2. **Accurate `lastSeen` over any duration.** A member's reported `lastSeen` is read from the cache, so a person last active 400 days ago shows their actual prior date even with a 90-day window. Without the cache, `lastSeen` could only ever resolve to a date inside the window.

The cache is keyed by org and is automatic - no extra configuration is required. When running outside GitHub Actions (e.g. via `local-action`), caching transparently no-ops and the audit behaves exactly as before.
